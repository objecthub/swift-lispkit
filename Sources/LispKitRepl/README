LISPKIT RELEASE CURRENT-VERSION
=====================

# OVERVIEW

LispKit is a framework for building Lisp-based extension and scripting
languages for macOS and iOS applications. LispKit is fully written in
the programming language Swift 5. LispKit implements a core language
based on the R7RS (small) Scheme standard. It is extensible, allowing
the inclusion of new native libraries written in Swift, of new libraries
written in Scheme, as well as custom modifications of the core
environment consisting of a compiler, a virtual machine as well as
the core libraries.
