;;; LISPKIT OBJECT
;;;
;;; This library implements a simple, delegation-based object system for LispKit.
;;; It provides procedural and declarative interfaces for objects and classes. The
;;; class system is optional. It mostly provides means to define and manage new
;;; object types and construct objects using object constructors.
;;;
;;; Similar to other Scheme and Lisp-based object systems, methods of objects are
;;; defined in terms of object/class-specific specializations of generic procedures.
;;; A generic procedure consists of methods for the various objects/classes it
;;; supports. A generic procedure performs a dynamic dispatch on the first parameter
;;; (the `self` parameter) to determine the applicable method.
;;;
;;; GENERIC PROCEDURES
;;; 
;;; Generic procedures can be defined using the `define-generic` form. Here is an
;;; example which defines three generic methods, one with only a `self` parameter,
;;; and two with three parameters `self`, `x` and `y`. The last generic procedure
;;; definition includes a `default` method which is applicable to all objects for
;;; which there is no specific method. When a generic procedure without default
;;; is applied to an object that does not define its own method implementation,
;;; an error gets signaled.
;;;
;;;   (define-generic (point-coordinates self))
;;;   (define-generic (set-point-coordinates! self x y))
;;;   (define-generic (point-move! self x y)
;;;     (let ((coord (point-coordinate self)))
;;;       (set-point-coordinate! self (+ (car coord) x) (+ (cdr coord) y))))
;;;
;;; OBJECTS
;;;
;;; An object encapsulates a list of methods each implementing a generic procedure.
;;; These methods are regular closures which can share mutable state. Objects do
;;; not have an explicit notion of a field or slot as in other Scheme or Lisp-based
;;; object systems. Fields/slots need to be implemented via generic procedures and
;;; method implementations sharing state. Here is an example explaining this
;;; approach:
;;;
;;;   (define (make-point x y)
;;;     (object ()
;;;       ((point-coordinates self)
;;;         (cons x y))
;;;       ((set-point-coordinates! self nx ny)
;;;         (set! x nx)
;;;         (set! y ny))
;;;       ((object-description self)
;;;          (string-append (object-description x) "/"
;;;                         (object-description y)))))
;;;
;;; This is a function creating new point objects. The `x` and `y` parameters of
;;; the constructor function are used for representing the state of the point
;;; object. The created point objects implement three generic procedures:
;;; `point-coordinates`, `set-point-coordinates`, and `object-description`. The
;;; latter procedure is defined directly by the library and, in general, used
;;; for creating a string representation of any object. By implementing the
;;; `object-description` method, the behavior gets customized for the object.
;;; 
;;; The following lines of code illustrate how point objects can be used:
;;;
;;;   (define pt (make-point 25 37))
;;;   pt                               => #object:#<box (...)>
;;;   (object-description pt)          => "25/37"
;;;   (point-coordinates pt)           => (25 . 37)
;;;   (set-point-coordinates! pt 5 6)
;;;   (object-description pt)          => "5/6"
;;;   (point-coordinates pt)           => (5 . 6)
;;;
;;; INHERITANCE
;;;
;;; The LispKit object system supports inheritance via delegation. The following
;;; code shows how colored points can be implemented by delegating all point
;;; functionality to the previous implementation and by simply adding only
;;; color-related logic.
;;;
;;;   (define-generic (point-color self) #f)
;;;   (define (make-colored-point x y color)
;;;     (object ((super (make-point x y)))
;;;       ((point-color self) color)
;;;       ((object-description self)
;;;         (string-append (object-description color) ":"
;;;                        (invoke (super object-description) self)))))
;;;
;;; The object created in function `make-colored-point` inherits all methods from
;;; object `super` which gets set to a new point object. It adds a new method to
;;; generic procedure `point-color` and redefines the `object-description` method. The
;;; redefinition is implemented in terms of the inherited `object-description` method
;;; for points. The form `invoke` can be used to refer to overridden methods in
;;; delegatee objects. Thus, `(invoke (super object-description) self)` calls the
;;; `object-description` method of the `super` object but with the identity (`self`)
;;; of the colored point.
;;;
;;; The following interaction illustrates the behavior:
;;;
;;;   (define cpt (make-colored-point 100 50 'red))
;;;   (point-color cpt)                    => red
;;;   (point-coordinates cpt)              => (100 . 50)
;;;   (set-point-coordinates! cpt 101 51)
;;;   (object-description cpt)             => "red:101/51"
;;;
;;; Objects can delegate functionality to multiple delegatees. The order in which
;;; they are listed determines the methods which are being inherited in case there
;;; are conflicts, i.e. multiple delegatees implement a method for the same
;;; generic procedure.
;;;
;;; CLASSES
;;;
;;; Classes add syntactic sugar, simplying the creation and management of objects.
;;; They play the following role in the object-system of LispKit:
;;;
;;;   1) A class defines a constructor for objects represented by this class.
;;;   2) Each class defines an object type, which can be used to distinguish objects
;;;      created by the same constructor and supporting the same methods.
;;;   3) A class also defines super-types for which the object type of a class is
;;;      considered a subtype.
;;;   4) A class can inherit methods implementing generic procedures from several
;;;      other classes, making it easy to reuse functionality. Inheritance is
;;;      orthogonal to subtyping.
;;;   5) A class defines methods implementing a number of generic procedures (which
;;;      potentially override inherited methods).
;;;   6) Classes are first-class objects supporting a number of class-related
;;;      procedures.
;;;
;;; The following code defines a `point` class with similar functionality as above:
;;;
;;;   (define-class (point x y) ()
;;;     (object ()
;;;       ((point-coordinates self)
;;;         (cons x y))
;;;       ((set-point-coordinates! self nx ny)
;;;         (set! x nx)
;;;         (set! y ny))
;;;       ((object-description self)
;;;         (string-append (object-description x) "/" (object-description y)))))
;;;
;;; Instances of this class are created by using the generic procedure `make-instance`
;;; which is implemented by all class objects:
;;;
;;;   (define pt2 (make-instance point 82 10))
;;;   pt2                                      => #point:#<box (...)>
;;;   (object-description pt2)                 => "82/10"
;;;
;;; Each object created by a class implements a generic procedure `object-class`
;;; referring to the class of the object. Since classes are objects themselves we
;;; can obtain their name with generic procedure `class-name`:
;;;
;;;   (object-class pt2)               => #class:#<box (...)>
;;;   (class-name (object-class pt2))  => point
;;;   (instance-of? point pt2)         => #t
;;;   (instance-of? point pt)          => #f
;;;
;;; Generic procedure `instance-of?` can be used to determine whether an object
;;; is a direct or indirect instance of a given class. The last two lines above
;;; show that `pt2` is an instance of `point`, but `pt` is not, even though it
;;; is functionally equivalent.
;;;
;;; The following definition re-implements the colored point example from above
;;; using a class:
;;;
;;;   (define-class (colored-point x y color) (point)
;;;     (if (or (< x 0) (< y 0))
;;;         (error "coordinates are negative: ($0; $1)" x y))
;;;     (object ((super (make-instance point x y)))
;;;       ((point-color self) color)
;;;       ((object-description self)
;;;         (string-append (object-description color) ":"
;;;                        (invoke (super object-description) self)))))
;;;
;;; The following lines illustrate the behavior of `colored-point` objects vs
;;; `point` objects:
;;;
;;;   (define cpt2 (make-instance colored-point 128 256 'blue))
;;;   (point-color cpt2)                    => blue
;;;   (point-coordinates cpt2)              => (128 . 256)
;;;   (set-point-coordinates! cpt2 64 32)
;;;   (object-description cpt2)             => "blue:64/32"
;;;   (instance-of? point cpt2)             => #t
;;;   (instance-of? colored-point cpt2)     => #t
;;;   (instance-of? colored-point cpt)      => #f
;;;   (class-name (object-class cpt2))      => colored-point
